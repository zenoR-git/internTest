## INTERNSHIP ASSIGNMENT
In this Assignment I have implemented two features.

1. A REST api to update profile [link](https://github.com/zenoR-git/internTest/blob/main/backend1/api-readme.md)

2. A simple chat backent implemented using socket.io [link](https://github.com/zenoR-git/internTest/blob/main/backend2/chat-readme.md)

## How to Install:

* In any terminal, (provided you have installed git):
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/zenoR-git/internTest.git
   ```

* You have to cd into backend1 folder and backend 2 folder and run the following:
  ```
  npm install
  node server.js 
  ```
